        <h2>My journey into Web Development</h2>
        <p><em>September 27, 2025 by Emeika Osbsourne</em></p>
        <p>As someone who has no experience in coding, or web desgins my journey has started off very rough. I am still trying to get used to it and to ensure that I am actually learning as the deeper I dive, the more interested I become in this life of coding. From Python, to JavaScript and now HTML, and i'm excited to see what more is to come.</p>
        <p>I am now learning CSS and seeing how styling could transform a simple, dull layout into a vibrant and enganging piece, and if you wish to take it further it could even be interactive.</p>

        <h2>How I feel about designing</h2>

        <p>As someone who was always fascinated with the desgin of websites, whether for fun or for making the website more accessible to its users. I believe every desgin choice serves a purpose. There is a website I used to always go on called RandomWebsites. You would basically just hit a red button on the site, and that button would randomly take you a different website. You'd look at some of them and wonder "Why did they even make this website"</p>
        <p> Then you start to realize, there are many times when you truly love doing something, you just do it without having no other reason but because it's fun for you, or relaxing. Some of the sites were silly and some were actually old sites that seemed no longer in use. As silly as it sounds, I would love to make a website one day so that it could end up on that site too.</p>

<h3>About me</h3> 
<p> I am a 20 year old Student attending The University Of the West Indies, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. With the dreams of one day becoming such an amazing coder that I can code my own game, maybe even owning a big gaming company in the future.</p>
<p> I am trying to turn coding in a current hobby of mine(Even thought it mostly feel like work), but in my spare times I tend to draw and express my artistic side as that tends to not only calm me but clear my mind.</p>
